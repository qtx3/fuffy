# fuffy
_fuffy_ is an open-source Discord bot with an unique approach for managing source files, with autonomy over the bot, as well as a clean and simple codebase.

⚠️ This will require some technical knowledge to implement. Don't feel discouraged though! Further down you'll find a super simple guide which even the daftest person will be able to follow.

## Benefits 🌸
* You're in charge, change anything you want - even the name and profile picture!

* Community-driven - due to the open-source nature of this project, everyone is able to contribute

* 100% free - as in freedom and as in cost

* Simple implementation thanks to the awesome documentation

* And if it matters to you:
    * Clean and small codebase
    * Permissive license

## Installation

### Desktop (not recommended, free)
Why do I not recommend this method? Here are a few reasons:
* Desktop off => Bot downtime
* Consumes energy and computer resources
* Endangers your security

### 3rd-party Host (recommended, free)
Finding a 3rd-party Host can be beneficial, as these can provide a free service to host your bot. There are free providors such as Heroku or PenguinBots.

### Dedicated Server (recommended, paid)
Having a own dedicated server will be the most reliable and performant, as it is reserved for your purposes. The downside is that renting a V-Server will cost some money.
